# NeuroGenesis

Guiding philosophy:
Biologically faithful computational model of the brain that leverages digital paradigms (parallelism, floating point, etc.)

Neuron:
- List of neurotransmitter types released
- List of types of receptors at dendrites
- List of synapses
- Resting membrane potential
- Action potential threshold
- Membrane potential
- ID

Receptor:
- List of matching neurotransmitters
- Behavior type (excitatory, inhibitory, modulatory)
- State (On/Off, time remaining)

Sensory Receptor:
- Behavior type
- Value

Synapse:
- Synaptic strength
    - Probability of release
    - Number of neurotransmitters released

Simulation Logic:
- Tick based
- Every tick (in order):
    - sensory receptors are reevaluated
    - all potential summations are recomputed
    - Action potentials are initiated
    - Axon neurotransmitters are released
    - Actions are taken if action neurons experience action potential
    - decay/propogation is incremented

Gene:
    - InterNeuron
        - Neurotransmitters
        - Receptors
            - MatchingNeurotransmitters
            - potentialPolarization
        - Type
        - actionPotentialThreshold
        - restingPotential
        - PotentialDecayRate
    - Synapses
        - fireProbability
        - PreSynapticNeuron
        - PostSynapticNeuron

Genome Encoding Structure:
- A genome is a sequence of Gene objects and a list of synaptic connections between all neurons, as well as parameters numNeurons and numSynapses
    - A gene corresponds to a Neuron or Synapse (is encoded as an array of floats)
- Creation Algorithm
    - Enumerate all InterNeurons, Sensory and Action neurons are enumerated according to the corresponding Enum
    - For each Neuron
        - Encode as a gene and append to Genome list
        - For each Synapse:
            - Encode as gene and append to Genome list
Assumptions:
- Synapse transmission is instantaneous
- No local membrane potentiation in dendrites/neurons, membrane potential is global
- Action potential travel time is instantaneous
- Receptor only is activated for one tick by each neurotransmitter

To Do:
- [ ] Decouple Neuronal/Brain Model from environment. Introduce interface for Brain
- [ ] When action potential fires, reduce potential harshly right afterwards
- [ ] Try negative neurons instead of synapses, less complexity
- [ ] Experiment with removing/reworking actionPotentialLength
- [ ] Come up with better solution for all the magic hardcoded constants (i.e. decay rate)
    - [ ] sensory normalization bound, max synaptic strength, survivor reproduction rate
- [ ] Implement culling useless neurons and synapses, neuronal pruning (also simulating exuberant synaptogenesis)
- [ ] Use Hebbian/SDTP to guide synaptogenesis (neurons that fire together wire together, neurons that fire out of sync lose their link). Synaptogenesis should not be random
- [ ] Implement mathematical models (differential equations, dynamic systems, analysis) for interactions like neural oscillations, electrotonic potential, cable theory, membrane potential decay, etc.
- [ ] Verify if Neurons is sorted normally by ID
- [ ] Reexamine actionPotentialTime tracking
- [ ] Reexamine encoding frequency based intensity of stimulus
- [ ] Reexamine order of computation for potentials in simulateStep
- [ ] Implement Fitness tracking
- [ ] Implement Neuron and Synapse monitoring per Organism
- [ ] Implement Neuron mutation
- [ ] Implement Adaptive Integrate-and-Fire model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model#Adaptive%20integrate-and-fire)
    - [ ] Read Neuronal Dynamics Ch 6. https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch6.S1.html
- [ ] Explore reinforcement learning instead of purely random search
- [ ] Add electrical gap-junctions
- [ ] Explore and implement oscillatory cyclic generation within neural networks
- [ ] Explore and implement neural plasticity
- [ ] Explore and implement information encoding schemes within neural signaling patterns
- [ ] Implement neural backpropogation of action potentials
- [ ] Explore NMDA(R)
- [ ] Why do axon terminals release nothing most of the time? Explore probability of release
- [ ] Implement modulatory synaptic behavior
- [ ] Implement keeping NeuronIDs consistent even with deleted neurons
